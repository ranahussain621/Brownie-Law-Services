                    Hello, my name is Patsy Moy. I am the founder of Brownie Link Services.
                    I have practiced law full-time since 2015 and will fully dedicate myself to managing this legal market e-platform in 2024.
                    One of the most rewarding tasks during my legal practice is to provide legal advice to the public under a free legal
                    advice program run by the Home Affairs Department in Hong Kong.

                    The program has offered an opportunity to meet up with people from all walks of life.
                    People come to me with a wide range of legal questions, for matters as trivial as minor
                    traffic offences and legal lawsuits arising from water leakage in their buildings to some
                    of the most important decisions in their life, such as divorce, child custody, probate or even criminal matters.

                    Even for legal questions which may look unimportant, such as minor traffic offences,
                    they could impact the livelihood of a family when the offender is a bus driver who may lose his job after conviction

                    Even the slightest legal trouble can create enormous mental stress on any law-abiding person. By and large,
                    all people want are both a quick fix and a complete cure to the legal headaches.

                            But the free legal advice program only offers each citizen about 20 minutes for preliminary legal advice. Those who need further advice always
                            ask me to recommend a law firm, or sometimes to estimate the legal cost if they want to hire a lawyer.

                            Unfortunately, I am not allowed under the law or the Code of Practice to make any referral. What I could do to help is suggest them to visit
                            the Law Society for a list of law firms and lawyers for their own selection.

                            For the legal industry, many lawyers in Hong Kong as well as in other Asian cities still remain very conservative or even passive when it comes to marketing, which is very likely due to the culture of maintaining their professional image.

                            Further, even online tools and apps have become a global trend for many years, many law firms still hesitate to use the new technology for different reasons and have yet prepared to build their own business websites for brand promotion.

                            However, many business opportunities may slip away due to their lack of readiness to fully embrace the technology.

                            Therefore, there is the market niche to build an e-platform to bridge lawyers with lay people who are anxiously looking for lawyers.  Since North America including Canada is well-known for its global leadership in technology, Brownie Link incorporates the technology from Canada into the legal sector in Hong Kong as its first step in hopes of building a win-win business environment for both Canada and the whole Asia eventually.
                            This e-platform is designed to provide people a 7x24 channel to select and access lawyers at their fingertips while we are also offering lawyers three different levels of membership to meet their budget and marketing needs.

                            We’d hope that this innovative mode of marketing will not just bring a stimulus to the legal industry in Asia, but that it will also benefit the general public by providing them with an informed choice while also paving the path for the IT sector in Canada to enter the Asian legal market.

                            It is never an easy task to decide a company name that can perfectly match its business nature.

                            On its surface, the name Brownie Link has no connection with legal services. But what about Apple, Oracle and Amazon? These company names are always entirely unrelated to their businesses.  According to Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, Jobs came up with the name simply because he liked apples.

                            For me, I like the Brownie dessert. To some degree, my choice of the company name is out of my personal preference. Besides, Brownies are also another name for Girl Scouts. Most important, the motto of Brownies is “Lend a Hand” - which is also the mission behind Brownie Link Services and its promise to the users when they are in need of our services.
